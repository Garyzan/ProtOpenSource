## Introduction

This repository contains a PlatformIO Project for creating an ESP32 based, interactive Protogen Visor.
I have created this as a means to counter often toxic and elitist behaviour when it comes to these types of Projects.
E.g. Little to no advice in groups and unwillingness to share Sourcecode for community use.

This code is therefore distributed at absolutely no profit (See Addendum for more information)

I strive to improve this code as critique and issues come in, so do not expect everything to be perfect.

Documentation is available in [/doc/DOCUMENTATION.md](https://github.com/PanickingLynx/ProtOpenSource/blob/master/doc/DOCUMENTATION.md)

Also, make sure to give the code Comments a quick read for some further Information.

## Personal Prerequisites

* At least minor knowledge of Arduino (C++) Code.
* Knowledge of electronics and soldering.
* Patience.

## Technical Prerequisites

* An ESP32 compatible Microcontroller.
* Two 64x32 Adafruit Compatible LED Matrices.
* A MAX4466 Amplified Microphone.
* Preferably an already built Visor.
* A computer running Windows, Linux, MacOS or a comparible modern Operating System.
* Visual Studio Code or a comparable Editor that supports the PlatformIO Extension. (Or even the PlatformIO Editor itself)
* LED Matrix Studio or a comparable Matrix drawing tool that supports exporting to byte / PROGMEM format.

## TODOs

* Add support for random animation play-ins.
* Remove all delays if possible.
* Make a dynamic animation loader.

## Known Issues

* Yelling state is never reached. (Need confirmation on that)

## Addendum

I really enjoyed making this code.
It was a fun experience to get back into doing some Arduino coding.

Without my Friend [@stabbypssm](https://twitter.com/stabbypssm) I wouldn't have gotten the idea, so a big thanks in that regard!
(Go check her out on Twitter!)

What I really took issue with during the creation of this code,
is that often when I looked up Protogen groups, which were sometimes even hidden behind a donation paywall,
is that many people there really take great pride in hiding their code away or acting elitist about their accomplishement.

Taking pride in your accomplishements is something that is everybody's right, but don't be a d**k about it.

This behaviour is in my eyes, very amateur-ish.

Please share this code, but remember one thing.

I DO NOT PROFIT IN ANY WAY FROM THIS PROJECT, IT IS COMPLETELY FREE TO USE AND I EXPECT NO GAINS FROM IT WHATSOEVER.

And with that, enjoy.

XOXO
